# Entry 7: Combining Each Pieces

## Recap
In the previous entry, I talked about the animation I put for the characters and adding in the music. In this entry, I will talk about the animation I made with the model that my partner made (this will be the character that the player controls) and the showing a demo of the game.

## Character Animation
