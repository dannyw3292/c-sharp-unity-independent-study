# Entry 7: Combining Each Piece

## Recap
In the previous entry, I talked about the animation I put for the characters and adding in the music. In this entry, I will talk about the animation I made with the model that my partner made (this will be the character that the player controls) and showing a demo of the game.

## Character Animation
I deleted the robot character since it's used for testing. The character below will be the model my partner made, which will be in the game. When I imported the model, there were bones sticking out. The problem was resolved by my partner.

## Image of Scene
This will be the scene of the game
You may see small black spots on the mountain. Those are the NPCs scattered throughout the map.

## Post Processing Stack
I downloaded the Post Processing Stack from the asset store in order to change the graphics of the game.
These are the changes I made to the graphics:

## Takeaways
* **Communicate with your partner** It is important to communicate with your partner since you are working together and that they are doing one part of the project. When they send you their work, there may be mistakes that you found. Your partner's part may work perfectly fine on their end, but when you combine your work with their's, troubles may appear. Talking to each other will allow you to find a solution.
