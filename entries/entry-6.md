# Entry 6: Animation And Adding NPCs

## Recap
In the previous entry, I talked about what I learned about creating animations for my character. In this entry, I will talk about the animations I creating and adding NPCs to the game by downloading models from the asset store.

## Character Animation
The model that my partner sent me can't be animated since the limbs will not move. I downloaded a robot model for me to test how to animate. I animated the robot's right leg incorrected, so it looks weird.
