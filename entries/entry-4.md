# Entry 4: MVP

## Recap
In the previous entry, I talked about the codes I learned and used to make the characters (player and npcs) move. In this entry, I will talk about the changes I made to the movements for the player and added controls using the mouse.

## Trial Code
```
```

## Useful Syntax
### 

## Player Movements


## Camera Movements


## Takeaways
* **Don't just copy tutorials and/or codes other people provide online.** There are many solutions for your problem(s) on the internet. You may be tempted to copy the solutions, but that won't help you learn. You can use it as a reference and learn from it. Also, the solution may not be exactly how you want your project to work. It's better to know how to solve instead of copy.
